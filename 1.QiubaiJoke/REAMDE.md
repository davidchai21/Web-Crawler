This is a very basic example of how a python web crawler works. It didn't use anything other than the urllib lib of Python. If you want to use this lib in python2 rather than python3, you should "import urllib2" as well since python3 merged urllib2 into urllib.

How to Run:
Simply runs "python3 qiubai.py" in the project folder.
